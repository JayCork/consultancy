## Running the API locally

To run the API locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the API server on `http://localhost:5173/`. You can then make requests to the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

```curl
curl http://localhost:5173/api/endpoint
```
